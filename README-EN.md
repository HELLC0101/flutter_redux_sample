### Branch

  - masterÔºöcall API with a static function ÔºåThe advantage is that the structure is simple, but it is not possible to write unit tests for the API, which is suitable for personal rapid development experience.
  - plusÔºöRedux joins MiddleWare, and Reducer uses combineReducers to cut into smaller granularity, making it easier to write UT for the reducer. The complexity is somewhat improved, but the structure is more rigorous, and it is convenient to use a more comprehensive UT to ensure the quality of the software in the iteration.
